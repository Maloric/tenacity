# Tenacity
## Summary
Tenacity is a framework that sits on top of Backbone, developed by [Avius](http://www.avius.com).

## Why?
Backbone is a famously non prescriptive framework, allowing an experienced developer to use whichever tools and libraries they prefer in order to build their application.  But it leaves a raft of decisions to make before you can start really building your application - which templating language should I use?  How will views talk to each other?

Tenacity is a the result of answering these questions at Avius.  We chose our templating language, wrote our boiler plate, chose a communication pattern, wrote views to help debug events throughout our application.  And then we wanted to make all of that hard work available to other projects.

## Getting Started
Coming soon.
